          <p>
            A barber (from the latin barber, "beard") is a whose occupation is
            mainly to cut, dress, groom, style and shave men's and boy's hair. A
            barber's place of work is known as a "barber shop" or a "barber's"
          </p>
          <p>
            In the modern times, the term "barber" is used both as professional
            title and to refer to hairdressers who specialize in men's hair.
            Historically, all hairdressers were considered barbers. In the 20th
            century, the profession of cosmetology branched of the barbering,
            and today hairdresser maybe licensed as either barbers or
            cosmetologists. Barbers different with respect to where they work,
            which services they are licensed to provide, and what name they use
            to refer to themselves. Part of the terminology difference depends
            on the regulations in a given location.
